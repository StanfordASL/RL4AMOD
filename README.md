Join us in moving the first steps toward the creation of publicly available benchmarks, datasets, and simulators for network-level coordination of MoD systems.

We aim to provide:
- Openly accessible simulation platforms across different fidelity levels (macroscopic, mesoscopic, microscopic)
- Calibrated scenarios
- Implementation of fleet coordination algorithms
- A common validation process that allows for direct comparison between different approaches (i.e., leaderboard-based)
- Standardized pipeline for contributed algorithms, scenarios, tools, etc.
